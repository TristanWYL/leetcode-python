# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

I have not came across an answer which meets the criterion:

    Assume the environment does not allow you to store 64-bit integers (signed or unsigned).

Though many answer can pass the tests, but in the proces of solving this problem, some integer variables do store a number overflowing 32bits. This is the reason why I post my answer here.

The boundaries for the 32-bit interger are $-2^{31}$ ~ $2^{31}-1$, i.e.  \-2147483648 ~ 2147483647, so when we compute the reverse, we accumulate the result from `x`'s tail to head, so we do this digit by digit, and keep comparing the reversed number to 214748364, which is derived by removing the last digit from the maximum/minimum which could be represented by 32 bits. In the meantime, when the result accumulates, we keep removing the last digit from `x`. the result accumulates up to an amount greater than 214748364, and `x` is not zero, we could declare that overflowing will happen.

We do not have to consider the remains in `x` after the result accumulates up to exactly 214748364, as when this happens, the first digit in th initial `x` should definitely be less than 2, otherwise the original `x` itself is overflowing.

Through this way, all integers appear to be 32 bits, and the criteria are met.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        # -2**31 ~ 2**31-1 corresponds to -2147483648 ~ 2147483647
        neg = x < 0
        if neg: x = -x
        result = 0
        while x != 0:
            tail = x % 10
            result = result * 10 + tail
            x //= 10
            if result > 214748364 and x != 0: return 0
        if neg: result *= -1
        return result
```

## complexity

- time: $O(length\ of\ the\ number)$
- space: $O(1)$
