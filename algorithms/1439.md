# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-kth-smallest-sum-of-a-matrix-with-sorted-rows/)

Intuitively, iteration over all possible combination (one number from each row) could solve this problem. As it refers to the kth smallest sum of the combination, a heap is applied.

**NOTE**

Replication could occur when iterating over the combinations, so a hash set is applied to check whether the current combination has appeared or not.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, mat: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
        m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
        pointers = [0] * m
        record = [(sum([row[0] for row in mat]), pointers)]
        seen = set()
        for _ in range(k-1):
            sum_cur, pointers = heapq.heappop(record)
            for i, pointer in enumerate(pointers):
                pointers_new = pointers.copy()
                pointers_new[i] += 1
                if pointers_new[i] != n:
                    pointers_new_tuple = tuple(pointers_new)
                    if pointers_new_tuple not in seen:
                        seen.add((pointers_new_tuple))
                        sum_new = sum_cur - mat[i][pointers[i]] + mat[i][pointers_new[i]]
                        heapq.heappush(record, (sum_new, pointers_new))
        return record[0][0]
```

## complexity

- time: O(k\*m\*n\*log(m))
- space: O(m^n)
