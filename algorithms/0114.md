# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/flatten-binary-tree-to-linked-list/)

Three tricks have been adopted to solve this problem, in the meantime, consume $O(1)$ memory.

Refer to the source code of [Solution 1](#solution-1) for the tricks.

Besides, we could traverse in another order:

    first: right
    second: left
    third: self

In this order, we could update the right/left 'slot' of nodes directly when traversing the tree, as the right/left children have been traversed before the update. Refer to [Solution 2](#solution-2) for details.

# Solution

## Solution 1

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        # trick 1: define a new variable to represent the previous node when traversing
        self._pre = TreeNode()
        def traverse(node):
            if node:
                # trick 2: we use left 'slot' to reference the traversed node to save the memory
                # cannot use the right 'slot' here, as the right child should be traversed before the re-target of the 'slot'
                self._pre.left = node
                self._pre = node
                traverse(node.left)
                traverse(node.right)
        traverse(root)
        # trick 3: traverse the left child, and convert it to a right-slanting tree
        node = root
        while node:
            node.right = node.left
            node.left = None
            node = node.right
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$

## Solution 2

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    _post = None
    def flatten(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> None:
        if root:
            self.flatten(root.right)
            self.flatten(root.left)
            root.right = self._post
            self._post = root
            root.left = None
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
