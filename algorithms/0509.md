# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/fibonacci-number/)

This problem can be solved in many ways. For example, intuitively top down, from `fib(n)` to `fib(n-1)`, then `fib(n-2)` till `fib(0)`, which is a recursive way. If we do not use cache to cache those solved `fib(i)`, the time complexity could be as expensive as $O(2^n)$. If cache is used, the complexity is just $O(n)$, but the space complexity will be $O(n)$.

There exists another way which could lower the time complexity to $O(n)$, and keep the space complexity as $O(1)$. Refer to the solution below for details.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def fib(self, n: int) -> int:
        if n == 0: return 0
        if n == 1: return 1
        res = 0
        i = 2
        pre = 1
        prepre = 0
        while i <= n:
            res = pre + prepre
            prepre = pre
            pre = res
            i += 1
        return res
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
