# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/)

The explanation from [this webpage](https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/discuss/211180/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Greedy-DFS) is quite exhaustive. The solution shown in this file uses the same principle.

In the solution, we define three states for each node: COVERED, NEEDED, LEAF.

Then we traverse the tree with DFS by the function `traverse` which returns the traversed node's state which is one of these three states.

NEEDED means a node needs a camera,
COVERED means a node has a child which has a camera,
LEAF means a leaf node, or, a node whose children are COVERED.


# Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    COVERED, NEEDED, LEAF = 1, 2, 3
    def minCameraCover(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        self.result = 0
        def traverse(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
            """
            @return: int: state: COVERED, NEEDED, LEAF
            """
            if root is None: return self.COVERED
            l, r = traverse(root.left), traverse(root.right)
            if l == self.LEAF or r == self.LEAF:
                self.result += 1
                return self.NEEDED
            if l == self.NEEDED or r == self.NEEDED: return self.COVERED
            # both l and r are COVERED
            return self.LEAF
        state = traverse(root)
        return self.result if state != self.LEAF else (self.result + 1)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
