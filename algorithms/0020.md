# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-parentheses/)

A stack could be used to solve this problem easily.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isValid(self, s: str) -> bool:
        stack = []
        mapping = {"}" : "{", ")":"(", "]":"["}
        for char in s:
            if stack and char in mapping and mapping[char] == stack[-1]: stack.pop()
            else: stack.append(char)
        return len(stack) == 0
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(n)$
