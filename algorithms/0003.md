# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters/)

This problem could be solved with Dynamic Programming. The core is to define the state. Here we define `result[i]` as the length of the longest substring, without repeating characters, which ends at `s[i]`. After updating all these states in the list, the maximum in the list is what we need. Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) for details.

**state compression**

Actually, `result[i]` only relies on `result[i-1]`, so we do not have to store all states. So after the state compression, we have [Solution 2](#solution-2).

# Solution

## Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0 or n == 1: return n
        # result[i] means the length of the longest substring,
        # without repeating characters, which ends at s[i]
        result = [0] * n
        result[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            pre_substring = s[i - result[i-1]:i]
            index = pre_substring.find(s[i])
            if index == -1:
                result[i] = result[i-1] + 1
            else:
                result[i] = len(pre_substring) - index
        return max(result)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(n)$

## Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        if n == 0 or n == 1: return n
        result = length = 1
        for i in range(1, n):
            index = s[i - length : i].find(s[i])
            if index == -1: length = length + 1
            else: length = length - index
            if length > result: result = length
        return result
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
