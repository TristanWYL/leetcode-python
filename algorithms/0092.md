# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list-ii/)

This problem is intuitively solvable, by three steps:
1. locate the {left}-th node
2. locate the start of the reversed list, i.e. the {right}-th node and switch the order when traversing nodes between {left} and {right}
3. process the connection with the reversed list


# Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def reverseBetween(self, head: Optional[ListNode], left: int, right: int) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if left == right: return head
        node = dummy = ListNode(next=head)
        # locate the {left}-th node
        for _ in range(left - 1):
            node = node.next
        prefix_of_reverse = node
        end = node.next
        # locate the start of the reversed list, i.e. the {right}-th node
        # and switch the order when traversing nodes between {left} and {right}
        node = end.next
        prev = end
        for _ in range(right - left):
            nxt = node.next
            node.next = prev
            prev = node
            node = nxt
        # process the connection with the reversed list
        start = prev
        postfix_of_reverse = node
        prefix_of_reverse.next = start
        end.next = postfix_of_reverse
        return dummy.next
        
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
