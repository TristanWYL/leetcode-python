# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/heaters/)

First of all, we should be able to know that the final solution lies in the continuum 

$$[0, max(houses[-1] - houses[0],abs(heaters[-1] - houses[0]), abs(houses[-1] - heaters[0]))]$$

Note here, the list $houses$ and $heaters$ have both been sorted in ascending order.

We have the solution space, then we could solve it with bisection.


# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def findRadius(self, houses: List[int], heaters: List[int]) -> int:
        houses.sort()
        heaters.sort()
        def possible(radius) -> bool:
            idx_heater = 0
            for idx_house in range(len(houses)):
                while abs(houses[idx_house] - heaters[idx_heater]) > radius:
                    if heaters[idx_heater] > houses[idx_house]:
                        # does not have to search further
                        return False
                    idx_heater += 1
                    if idx_heater >= len(heaters):
                        return False
            return True
        left, right = 0, max(houses[-1] - houses[0], abs(heaters[-1] - houses[0]), abs(houses[-1] - heaters[0]))
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            print(mid)
            if possible(mid):
                right = mid -1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        return left
```

## complexity

- time: 

  Assume there are $N$ houses and $M$ heaters, and the width of the solution space is $K$, the time complexity is: 

  $$O(NlogN) + O(MlogM) + O((M+N)\times logK)$$

- space: $O(1)$
