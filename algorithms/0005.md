# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/)

We could use a `matrix` to store the palindromic result, where the row number `i` represents the start of the substring, and the column number `j` represents the end (inclusive) of the substring.

e.g. 

```python
matrix[i][j] = True
```
means the substring `s[i][j+1]`  is palindromic.

With the matrix storing the palindromic situation, we could check the substring from shortest to longest, as this way could re-use the previous checking results.

An embedded loop could help solve the problem, so the time complexity is $O(N^2)$.


# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, s: str) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        matrix = [[False]*n for _ in range(n)]
        result = (0, 0)
        for i in range(n):
            matrix[i][i] = True
        for delta in range(1, n):
            for start in range(0, n-delta):
                end = start + delta
                if s[start] == s[end]:
                    if delta == 1 or matrix[start+1][end-1]:
                        matrix[start][end] = True
                        if delta > result[-1] - result[0]:
                            result = (start, end)
        return s[result[0]:result[-1]+1]
```

## complexity

- time: $O(N^2)$
- space: $O(N^2)$
