# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-th-smallest-pair-distance/)

It seems that we have to compare one number to every other number, and store the difference in a collection, and sort the collection. This problem resolved. However, this results in a complexity of $n^2$.

If we sort the array first before we do other things, and then consider the fact that given a number in the sorted list, the further another number is away from the given number, the greater the difference is. This means that we do not have to calculate all differences between any two numbers. In this case, we use a heap to store the difference from least number to greater number. Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) which gives a complexity of $O(n\times log(n) + k)$. If k is not great, this algorithm works, but k could be as great as $C_n^2$, and in this case, this algorithm would time out.

Let us think about another algorithm. 

We could sort the array first in ascending order. Given the fact that $distance$ is in the division $[0, nums[-1]-nums[0]]$, we could use binary search to find the proper distance $mid$ which could have just $k$ distances before it. Refer to [Solution 2](#solution-2) for the algorithm. For each iteration, the computational complexity is $O(N)$, and considering it is binary search, the times for searching is $O(log(nums[-1]-nums[0]))$, so the resulted complexity is $O(N\times log(nums[-1]-nums[0]))$.

# Solution

## Solution 1 
```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        records = [(nums[i+1]-nums[i], (i+1, i)) for i in range(len(nums) - 1)]
        heapq.heapify(records)
        for _ in range(k-1):
            idx_end, idx_start = heapq.heappop(records)[1]
            idx_end_new = idx_end + 1
            if idx_end_new != len(nums):
                heapq.heappush(records, (nums[idx_end_new] - nums[idx_start], (idx_end_new, idx_start)))
        return records[0][0]
```

### complexity

- time: $O(n\times log(n) + k)$
- space: $O(n)$

## Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestDistancePair(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        def isPossible(mid) -> bool:
            '''given the difference mid, whether it is possible that there are k-1 distances less than or equal to mid'''
            left, cnt = 0, 0
            for right in range(1, len(nums)):
                while nums[right] - nums[left] > mid:
                    left += 1
                cnt += right - left
            return cnt >= k
        
        nums.sort()
        l, r = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if isPossible(mid):
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
```

### complexity
- time: $O(N\times log(nums[-1]-nums[0]))$
- space: $O(1)$
