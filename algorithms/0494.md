# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/)

Intuitively, we could use `backtrack` to traverse all possible combinations of the elements in `nums`, and the problem could be solved, with both time and space complexity as $O(2^n)$. Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) for details.

In addition, a constraint of the problem gives that all items in `nums` are no less than 0. Based on this, there exists another solution. In any doable combinations, we could group the elements by the sign into two subsets `A` and `B`. Assume the negative sign will be applied to `B` set. As this is a doable classification, the following expressions holds:

$$
  \sum A - \sum B = target \\
  \sum A = \sum B + target \\
  2\times \sum A = \sum A + \sum B + target \\
  2\times \sum A = \sum nums + target \\
  \sum A = (\sum nums + target) / 2  \space\space\space\space\space\space\space\space (1)
$$

As such, this problem could be converted into another problem: given `sums` and `target`, how many different subsets of `sums` could make the equation `(1)` hold. This question could be solved easily with dynamic programing. Check out [Solution 2](#solution-2) for details. This idea is from [labuladong](https://labuladong.github.io/algo/3/23/73/#三动态规划).

# Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        self.nums = nums
        self.target = target
        self.cache = {}
        return self.backtrace(0, 0)
        
    def backtrace(self, cur_sum, cur_index):
        if (cur_sum, cur_index) in self.cache: return self.cache[(cur_sum, cur_index)]
        if cur_index == len(self.nums):
            if cur_sum == self.target: return 1
            else: return 0
        cnt1 = self.backtrace(cur_sum + self.nums[cur_index], cur_index + 1)
        self.cache[(cur_sum + self.nums[cur_index], cur_index + 1)] = cnt1
        cnt2 = self.backtrace(cur_sum - self.nums[cur_index], cur_index + 1)
        self.cache[(cur_sum - self.nums[cur_index], cur_index + 1)] = cnt2
        return cnt1 + cnt2
```

## complexity

- time: $O(2^n)$
- space: $O(2^n)$


# Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def findTargetSumWays(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
        target_for_subset = (sum(nums) + target) / 2
        if  int(target_for_subset) != target_for_subset or target_for_subset < 0 or target > sum(nums):
            return 0
        # dp[i][j] means the number of doable combination, given:
        # 1. the first i elements in nums,
        # 2. and j is the required target
        dp = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        target = int(target_for_subset)
        for i in range(len(nums)+1): dp[i] = [1] * (target + 1)
        for j in range(target+1): dp[0][j] = 0 # no elements from nums, no target will be achieved
        dp[0][0] = 1 # this means emptiness can lead to the target of 0
        for i in range(1, len(nums)+1):
            for j in range(target+1):
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
                if j-nums[i-1] >= 0:
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j-nums[i-1]]
        return dp[len(nums)][target]
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n*target)$
- space: $O(n*target)$
