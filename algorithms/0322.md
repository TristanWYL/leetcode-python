# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/)

This problems could be solved by many ways.

First way is bottom-up, in iteration. The basic idea for this solution is that 
1. using `numForEachAmount` for storing the needed number of coins for the amount which is the corresponding index of this array,
2. the needed number of coins with latter index is based on the number of coins with former index,

Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) for more details.


The second way is top-down, in recursion. Also we need to memorize the solved subproblems, so as to reduce the time complexity from $O(m^n)$ to $O(m*n)$. One thing needing to note is that, for some subproblems, even if the returned value is `-1`, we still need to memorize it, which could reduce the computation time significantly.

# Solution

## Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if amount == 0: return 0
        UP_BOUNDARY = amount+1
        numForEachAmount = [UP_BOUNDARY] * (amount + 1)
        numForEachAmount[0] = 0
        for a in range(1, amount+1, 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a >= c:
                    numForEachAmount[a] = min(numForEachAmount[a], 1 + numForEachAmount[a - c])
        return -1 if numForEachAmount[-1] == UP_BOUNDARY else numForEachAmount[-1]
```

## complexity

Let n equal to `amount`, and let m be the number of coins in `coins`

- time: $O(m*n)$
- space: $O(n)$

## Solution 2


```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.amount_num_pair = {}
        
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        if amount == 0: return 0
        if amount < 0: return -1
        if amount in self.amount_num_pair: return self.amount_num_pair[amount]
        res = amount + 1
        for c in coins:
            num = self.coinChange(coins, amount - c) + 1
            if num == 0: continue
            if num < res: res = num
        if res == amount + 1: res = -1
        self.amount_num_pair[amount] = res
        return res
```

## complexity

Let n equal to `amount`, and let m be the number of coins in `coins`

- time: $O(m*n)$
- space: $O(n)$
