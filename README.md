# Leetcode solutions in Python

Hi there, as scheduled, I should do one question daily. However, recently I took a new job role, and it is f***ing stressing, and basically I am always overloaded. So the update of this repository may be delayed, but I promise that I will keep updating it.

A warm reminder for everybody:

    Never engage into a hectic job, as it could drastically deteriorate your life, unless you are a workaholic.

    Best wishes for all of us! Keep healthy and stay safe!

Features:

✅ Clear explanation<br>
✅ Time complexity and space complexity<br>
✅ Some problems may include more than one solution

Actively being updated. STAY TUNED!
