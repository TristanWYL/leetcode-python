# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/koko-eating-bananas/)

The eating speed $k$ lies in $[1, max(piles)]$. Intuitively, a double iteration over the number of piles, and over $max(piles)$ can give a list of available speeds, among which we could get the minimum speed. This could solve the problem, but result in a complexity of $O(m\times n)$ where $m$ is the number of piles, while $n$ is $max(piles)$.

Considering the solution is in $[1, max(piles)]$, bisection searching could be appied to reduce the complexity to $O(m\times log(n))$.

**NOTE**


# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def minEatingSpeed(self, piles: List[int], h: int) -> int:
        def possible(mid: int) -> bool:
            t = 0
            for pile in piles:
                t += (pile + mid - 1)//mid
            return t <= h
        l, r = 1, max(piles)
        while l <= r:
            mid = (l + r) // 2
            if possible(mid):
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return l
        
```

## complexity

- time: $O(m\times log(n))$
- space: $O(1)$
