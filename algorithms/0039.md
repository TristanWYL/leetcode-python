# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum/)

Intuitively, this problem could be solved by Dynamic Programing. The state is defined as `dp[i]` which means to achieve a sum of `i`, the available combinations. Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) for details.

In addition, this problem could also be solved by Backtrack. The details are quite straightforward. Check out [Solution 2](#solution-2) for details.

# Solution

## Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        n = len(candidates)
        dp = [[] for _ in range(target+1)]
        for c in range(1, n + 1):
            for t in range(1, target + 1):
                pre = t - candidates[c-1]
                if pre == 0:
                    dp[t].append([candidates[c-1]])
                elif pre > 0:
                    for k in dp[pre]:
                        dp[t].append(k+[candidates[c-1]])
        return dp[target]
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n*target)$
- space: $O(target)$

## Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def combinationSum(self, candidates: List[int], target: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        def backtrack(start, path, remain):
            if remain < 0 : return
            if remain == 0:
                self._result.append(path)
            else:
                for i in range(start, len(candidates)):
                    backtrack(i, path + [candidates[i]], remain - candidates[i])
        self._result = []
        backtrack(0, [], target)
        return self._result
```
