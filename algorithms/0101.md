# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Basic idea is to ignore the root and divide the tree into two trees, and then check the symmetric property of the two trees.

# Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    
    def isSymmetric(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def isMirrored(p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
            if p is None or q is None: return p is None and q is None
            return p.val==q.val and isMirrored(p.left, q.right) and isMirrored(p.right, q.left)
        return isMirrored(root.left, root.right)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
