# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

The problem could be solved by DP. The core part of the solution is to construct the state. Here the state is represented with `dp[]` where `dp[i]` means the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence which ENDs with `num[i]`. With this definition, the state transfer function can be easily inferred. This solution gives a complexity of $O(N^2)$. Refer to [Solution 1](#solution-1) for the code.

There exists another solution which gives a complexity of $O(N*log(N))$. Maintain an array `dp[]` for storing the possible strictly increasing subsequence. Then iterate the `nums` from start to end. Apply `bisec_left()` to find where to insert the `num` of `nums` into `dp[]`. The code is concise and self-explanary. Refer to [Solution 2](#solution-2) for details.

# Solution

## Solution 1

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] * len(nums) # dp[i] means the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence which ENDs with num[i]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        return max(dp)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(N^2)$
- space: $O(N)$

## Solution 2

```python
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = []
        for num in nums:
            place = bisect_left(dp, num)
            if place == len(dp): dp.append(num)
            # This line will not extend the dp, but only update `dp[]`
            # The reason for this is that, for example, when  
            # `place==len(dp)-1`, here we have `num<=dp[-1]`
            # to do this can make the last item in `dp` reasonably smaller, which could 
            # benefit in the following iteration 
            # when there is another `num` which is greater than the 
            # `num` here, and less than the `dp[-1]` here. Think about this carefully!
            else: dp[place] = num
        return len(dp)
```
