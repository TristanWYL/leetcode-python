# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/best-time-to-buy-and-sell-stock/)

The philosophy of DP could be applied for this problem. The state is the `prices`, and the value is current max profit, current candidate high price, and current candidate low price which are represented by `cur_max_profit`, `cur_candidate_low` and `cur_candidate_high` in the program. So when we iterate over the `prices`, keep updating these three values, and do a comparison at the end of the program. Refer to the following code for details.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        cur_max_profit = 0
        cur_candidate_low = cur_candidate_high = prices[0]
        for p in prices:
            if p > cur_candidate_high:
                cur_candidate_high = p
            elif p < cur_candidate_low:
                cur_max_profit = max(cur_max_profit, cur_candidate_high - cur_candidate_low)
                cur_candidate_low = cur_candidate_high = p
        return max(cur_max_profit, cur_candidate_high - cur_candidate_low)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
