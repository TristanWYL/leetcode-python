# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock/)

The solution in this page has heavily referenced [this](https://leetcode.com/problems/open-the-lock/discuss/1250580/C%2B%2BJavaPython-BFS-Level-Order-Traverse-Clean-and-Concise), but I do not agree with the complexity it gives.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def openLock(self, deadends: List[str], target: str) -> int:
        def neighbours(code):
            for i in (0, 1, 2, 3):
                for sign in (-1, 1):
                    yield code[:i] + str((int(code[i]) + sign)%10) + code[i+1:]
        queue = deque(["0000"])
        deadends = set(deadends)
        steps = 0
        while queue:
            for _ in range(len(queue)):
                code = queue.popleft()
                if code == target: return steps
                if code in deadends: continue
                deadends.add(code)
                for _next in neighbours(code):
                    queue.append(_next)
            steps += 1
        return -1
```

## complexity

- time: $O(m^n)$ where `m` is the number of alphabet (10 in our case), while `n` is number of digits (4 in our case).
- space: $O(m^n)$
