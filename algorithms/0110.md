# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/balanced-binary-tree/)

The key of the solution is to construct the function for recursion. This is a little tricky, but still heuristic. First, we have to compare the depth of two branches of each tree node, so the function should return the depth of the passed tree node argument. Second, if the passed tree node argument is not balanced, the function should return False directly. To meet these criteria, we construct a function which accepts the tree node as an argument, and rethrn a tuple which includes a bool for indicating whether the passed tree is balanced, and an integer for indicating the depth of the passed tree.


# Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def isBalanced(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
        def isTwoTreesBalanced(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> Tuple[bool, int]:
            """
            @return Tuple[bool, int]:
                First item of the tuple is to indicate whether root is balanced
                Second item is for the depth of the tree represented by root
            """
            if root is None: return True, 0
            p = isTwoTreesBalanced(root.left)
            q = isTwoTreesBalanced(root.right)
            return p[0] and q[0] and abs(p[1]-q[1]) <= 1, max(p[1], q[1]) + 1
        return isTwoTreesBalanced(root)[0]
        
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
