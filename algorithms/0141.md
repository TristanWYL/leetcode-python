# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/submissions/)

Two persons run around the same road. If one of them is constantly quicker than the other one, the quicker one will definitely catch up with the other one, if there is a circle.

# Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        walker = runner = head
        while runner and runner.next:
            walker = walker.next
            runner = runner.next.next
            if walker == runner:
                return True
        return False
        
```

## complexity

- time: $O(n)$
- space: $O(1)$
