# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/russian-doll-envelopes/)

The core of the solution includes two parts:

1. Sorting `envelopes` cleverly,
2. After step 1, the problem has been converted into a `Longest Increasing Subsequence` problem. Refer to [Problem 300](0300.md) for more details.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxEnvelopes(self, envelopes: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        # Note the sorting here carefully.
        # Sort `envelopes` first by `item[0]` and then by `-item[1]`
        # The reason for this is that when we try to get the longest 
        # strictly increasing subsequence, in the subgroup of envelopes
        # with the same `item[0]`, only one item will be counted in `dp[]`
        envelopes = sorted(envelopes, key=lambda item: (item[0], -item[1]))
        dp = []
        for _, height in envelopes:
            left = bisect_left(dp, height)
            if left == len(dp): dp.append(height)
            else: dp[left] = height
        return len(dp)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(NlogN)$
- space: $O(logN)$
