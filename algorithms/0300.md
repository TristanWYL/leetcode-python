# Explanation

[Problem Description](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/)

The problem is solved by DP. The core part of the solution is to construct the state. Here the state is represented with `dp[]` where `dp[i]` means the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence which ENDs with `num[i]`. With this definition, the state transfer function can be easily inferred.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def __init__(self):
        self.dp = [1]
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [1] * len(nums) # dp[i] means the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence which ENDs with num[i]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            for j in range(i):
                if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        return max(dp)
```

## complexity

- time: $O(N^2)$
- space: $O(N)$
